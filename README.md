# Nightshade
**Project name:** Nightshade

**Description:** This project idea is rooted in security. This project will be able to show people the simple and dangerous threat that is posed due to unsecure "free" wifi network. The project is an embedded system designed to fit inside a phone case that will allow a user to deploy a free wifi hotspot. This will then track all the data that is being routed through the device.
